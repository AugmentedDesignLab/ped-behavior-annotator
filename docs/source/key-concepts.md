The behavior tags for pedestrian decision-making are inspired by YouTube video observations, PSI Dataset annotations, and various factors influencing pedestrian crossing decisions. The tags are categorized into four main types: Pedestrian Behaviors, Vehicle Behaviors, Environment Conditions, and Pedestrian Demographics. These categories help describe key interactions and context factors in multi-frame scenes.

Pedestrian behavior tags are further divided into subsets like Instant Reaction, Collision, Interaction, Mental State, and Intention. Vehicle behavior tags include subsets like Collision, Interaction, and Irregular phenomena. The tagging system is designed to be intuitive and scalable, incorporating ideas from existing literature to enhance pedestrian behavior analysis.
