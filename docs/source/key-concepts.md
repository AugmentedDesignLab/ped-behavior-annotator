# Main features

## Predefined tags
Predefined behavior tags are split into three categories: pedestrian behavior, vehicle behavior, and environment conditions. They are accessible in the AnnotationEditView, in the form of check boxes, to annotate the behaviors and conditions in each frame or group of frames. Using predefined tags allows for unity across annotations and resulting data sets and makes it easier to identify patterns or common pedestrian-vehicle interaction scenarios. 

## Multi-frame annotation

## Public video annotation
PedAnalyze makes it possible to annotate public videos of pedestrian-vehicle accidents or near-miss scenarios stored on the internet, generally posted on platforms such as YouTube or Instagram. On these platforms, there exists an abundance of footage that the public has already organized into compilations. By directly supporting YouTube links, and direct access to videos on other social media platforms coming in the future, PedAnalyze is able to access this useful yet untapped set of pre-compiled interactions and provide a tool to easily identify and annotate behaviors.
