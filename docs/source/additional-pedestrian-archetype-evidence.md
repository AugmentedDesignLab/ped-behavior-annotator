# Additional Pedestrian Archetype Evidence

We didn't have enough space in our paper to include many examples, so we've included them here for further evidence of our archetypes.

## Wanderer
Wanderers show diverse behaviors. In [1], a pedestrian runs towards an oncoming vehicle, forcing it to stop, and climbs onto the hood. In [2], another dances on the highway, stopping traffic. When intoxicated, wanderers become even more dangerous, rapidly changing direction or speed [3].

## Drunk

In [2], another pedestrian stands outside the highway lanes and suddenly falls on their back, unintentionally stum- bling into the driving lane. With no intention or action to cross, the drunk still manages to risk colliding with high-speed vehicles. Like the wanderer, the drunk comes in many forms. In video [3], [4], the drunk crosses by crawling (using legs and hands). In video [5], the drunk walks blindly and crashes into the midsection of a moving bus. In [1], they wander along the driving lane.

## Blind
In [1], while crossing, the pedestrian listens to music and plays with their phone. The approaching vehicle honks at them, but they do not budge from their path. Without noticing the surroundings, they cross a four-lane road on a green signal. Such behavior is often common in rare scenarios [2], [3].

## Flock
In [1], one flock member leaves others behind, scared by the approaching vehicle. One wants to continue crossing in [2], but the other drags them and retreats off the road. In [3], one of the two pedestrians crosses the road, and the other retreats to the previous lane. Things get more complicated when the flock is on scooters and violates the signal on high-speed roads [4].

## Eventful
Pedestrians can also drop items on the road [1], [2]. In [2], a kid crossing with a group drops one of their sandals on the road and falls behind the group. Occluded pedestrians can unexpectedly appear anywhere on the road [3], [4]. While in more common scenarios, occluded pedestrians appear from around a stopped vehicle, in [4], we see an event when the occluded pedestrian appears from the front of a high-speed vehicle moving at over 40 mph!
